# 🌿 AyurVichar – Your Ayurvedic Lifestyle Analyzer

AyurVichar is a modern web application that helps individuals discover their **Prakruti** — the Ayurvedic body type that defines their physical and mental constitution.  
The platform also provides **personalized diet, lifestyle, and wellness suggestions** based on traditional Ayurvedic wisdom.

---

## 🚀 Problem Overview

In today’s fast-moving world, health recommendations are often generalized. Ayurveda teaches that every person is unique — what’s healthy for one may not be ideal for another.  
Understanding your **Prakruti** (Vata, Pitta, or Kapha) is essential for achieving balance and preventing disease.

---

## 💡 Our Approach

Traditional Prakruti evaluations usually require long consultations and in-person sessions. AyurVichar simplifies this by using an **AI-driven questionnaire and chatbot** that analyzes responses instantly and provides customized insights and guidance.  
This makes Ayurvedic self-assessment **accessible, fast, and easy** for everyone.
